## Teaching Philosophy:

I view teaching physics and astronomy as more than the transfer of knowledge — it is an opportunity to train students in critical thinking and scientific reasoning that will serve them well beyond the classroom. Whether I am teaching algebra-based physics, calculus-based physics, or introductory astronomy, I emphasize connecting fundamental principles to real-world and cutting-edge applications. My background in gravitational wave astrophysics, machine learning, and atmospheric physics allows me to bring fresh research examples into lectures, helping students see science as a living and evolving discipline.

I believe students learn best through active engagement. I encourage problem-solving, guided inquiry, and classroom demonstrations that bring abstract concepts to life. I aim to foster an inclusive environment where all students feel comfortable asking questions, exploring ideas, and developing confidence in their scientific abilities. My goal is not only for students to simply succeed in exams, but to leave my courses with a deeper appreciation for how the universe works and the tools to analyze it for themselves.
