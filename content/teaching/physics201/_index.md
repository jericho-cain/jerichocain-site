## Course Description
This course introduces the principles of classical mechanics, with an emphasis on applications relevant to life science, pre-medical, and technology-oriented fields. Topics include linear and two-dimensional motion, forces and Newton’s laws, energy, momentum, circular motion, and rotational dynamics. The course is algebra-based and designed for students pursuing science-related majors, including pre-medical, pre-dental, pre-chiropractic, and pre-physical therapy tracks.

Students will gain both conceptual understanding and practical experience through integrated laboratory activities, quantitative problem-solving, and the exploration of physics in real-world and technological contexts.
