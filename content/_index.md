Welcome! My name is **Dr. Jericho Cain**. Iâ€™m a physicist, astronomer, tech professional, educator, and astrophotographer.  

These days I work full time in the tech industry as an AI researcher, applying machine and deep learning to real-world problems. I also teach one college physics class per quarter. Alongside that, I continue my academic work in gravitational wave astrophysics, focusing on the intersection of deep learning and the search for signals from the cosmos.
