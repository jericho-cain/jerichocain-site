Welcome! My name is **Dr. Jericho Cain**. I’m a physicist, astronomer, tech professional, educator, and astrophotographer.  

These days I work full time in the tech industry as an **AI researcher**, applying machine and deep learning to real-world problems. I also teach one college physics class per quarter. Alongside that, I continue my academic work in **gravitational wave astrophysics**, focusing on the intersection of **deep learning** and the search for signals from the cosmos.  

My research background spans **Gravitational Wave Astrophysics, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Atmospheric Physics, and Theoretical Acoustics**. I enjoy bridging physics with computational methods to uncover new insights about the universe.  

As a teacher, I’ve had the privilege of instructing both majors and non-majors in **algebra-based physics, calculus-based physics, physical science, and astronomy**. My goal is to make science accessible, rigorous, and inspiring for all students.  

Outside of work, I pursue **astrophotography** under the banner of *Bellatrix Observatory* — a project named in honor of my late dog — you can find my pictures here.
