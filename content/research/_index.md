# Research

My research spans **gravitational-wave astrophysics**, **deep learning**, **machine learning**, **atmospheric physics**, and **theoretical acoustics**.  
These days I work full-time in tech as an **AI researcher**, but I continue gravitational wave research on the side — at the intersection of deep learning and gravitational wave astronomy.
