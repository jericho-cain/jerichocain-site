# Research

My research spans **gravitational-wave astrophysics**, **deep learning**, **machine learning**, **atmospheric physics**, and **theoretical acoustics**.  
These days I work full-time in tech as an **AI researcher**, but I continue gravitational wave research on the side — at the intersection of deep learning and gravitational wave astronomy.

## Latest Project

[Gravitational Wave Hunting with CWT-LSTM in LIGO Data](https://github.com/jericho-cain/gravWH/tree/aws-ligo-data). 

I develop novel machine learning architectures that combine continuous wavelet transforms with LSTM autoencoders to detect gravitational wave signals buried in LIGO interferometer noise, enabling the discovery of previously undetectable astrophysical events.
